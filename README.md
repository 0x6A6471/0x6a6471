# [jakequinter.io](https://jakequinter.io/)

My personal site changes often. I treat it as a space where I can implement new technologies I find interesting. You will notice two directories:

### nextjs 
This is the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version of my website, which can be viewed at [jakequinter.io](https://jakequinter.io).

In the latest iteration, I updated to use Next.js 13 app directory with React Server Components.


### rust 
This is the [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/)/[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) version of my website, which can be viewed at [https://https://jakequinter-io.fly.dev/](https://https://jakequinter-io.fly.dev/).

This is currently a work in progress while I'm exploring Rust/Wasm.
