        Although I try to eat healthy ~95% of the time, my girlfriend and I love
        food. We love trying new restaurants, cuisines, keeping track of what we
        loved, what we liked, and what we didn&apos;t care for. Since moving to
        Boston, we have been introduced to a new realm of restaurants. It&apos;s
        quite different than what we were accustomed to in Appleton, WI.
        There&apos;s food everywhere here. So, we thought it would be cool to
        keep track of the food we&apos;ve tried, give it a rating, and remember
        it for future reference.
