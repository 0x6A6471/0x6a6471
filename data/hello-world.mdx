Writing is an invaluable skill, and I enjoy writing and getting lost in thought. I spent my Saturday redesigning and styling my personal site, so what a better time to start a blog. This article will go over how I did it.

## Picking the technology

With the recent beta release of the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/), initially I planned to use Notion to implement my blog. Although I do intend to migrate towards the Notion API, as it sits right now, the functionally it offers just isn't quite there yet. The main issue for me not choosing the Notion API is that it doesn't currently support code blocks.

I'm intending to write/blog about development and not having code blocks seemed like a major issue.

I have used [react-notion](https://github.com/splitbee/react-notion), which uses Notion as a CMS. This has worked quite well in the past, but the one thing I don't like with using Notion is the inability to customize colors, (i.e., text colors, code blocks).

I finally decided to use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which allows for a lot of flexibility because it allows you to integrate with JSX.

## MDX Setup

I didn't want to overcomplicate getting the blog set up, so I started looking for a few examples online. [Vercel](https://vercel.com) offer's an excellent [Github repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples) full of tons of examples using various technologies. I looked over the mdx example, and quickly got set up.

Here is my _\`getStaticProps\`_ function at my _\`/blog\`_ route that is used to pre-fetch my blogs.

```
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  const posts = postFilePaths.map(filePath => {
    const source = fs.readFileSync(path.join(POSTS_PATH, filePath));
    const { content, data } = matter(source);

    return {
      content,
      data,
      filePath,
    };
  });

  return { props: { posts } };
}
```

<p style={{ paddingTop: 16 }}></p>

_\`postFilePaths\`_ is a function that reads from my _\`data\`_ directory where I have all of my _\`.mdx\`_ files.

## Customization

_\`MDX\`_ allows customizable styles for the markdown that you render. For simplicity sake, the _\`MDXRemote\`_ component from the _\`next-mdx-remote\`_ library takes in a _\`components\`_ prop that you can define with your own styles.

```
const components = {
  a: CustomLink,
  h1: H1,
  h2: H2,
  h3: H3,
  p: P,
  ul: UL,
  li: LI,
  em: Code,
	pre: props => (
		<Highlight
		  {...defaultProps}
      theme={determineTheme()}
      code={props.children.props.children}
      language="jsx"
    >
      {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
        <pre className={pre()} style={style}>
          {tokens.map((line, i) => (
            <div
              className={styleline()}
              key={i}
              {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}
            >
              <span className={linecontent()}>
                {line.map((token, key) => (
                  <span key={key} {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
                ))}
              </span>
            </div>
          ))}
        </pre>
      )}
    </Highlight>
  ),
};
```

As you can see I created a _\`components\`_ object and am replacing the default markdown styles. I am replacing the anchor, heading, paragraph, list, and code tags with my own personal styles.

The _\`pre\`_ key in my _\`components\`_ object is what styles the following code block:

```
	function styling() {
		return 'This is pretty cool';
	}
```
