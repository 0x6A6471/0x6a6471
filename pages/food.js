          My girlfriend and I love food. We love trying new places, cuisines,
          keeping track of what we loved, what we liked, and what we didnâ€™t care
          for. Since moving to Boston, we have been introduced to a new realm of
          restaurants. Itâ€™s quite different than what we were accustomed to in
          Appleton, WI. Thereâ€™s food everywhere here. So, we thought it would be
          cool to keep track of the food weâ€™ve tried, give it a rating, and
          remember it for future reference.
