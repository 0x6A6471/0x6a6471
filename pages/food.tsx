        My girlfriend and I love food. We love trying new places, cuisines,
        keeping track of what we loved, what we liked, and what we didn‚Äôt care
        for. Since moving to Boston, we have been introduced to a new realm of
        restaurants. It‚Äôs quite different than what we were accustomed to in
        Appleton, WI. There‚Äôs food everywhere here. So, we thought it would be
        cool to keep track of the food we‚Äôve tried, give it a rating, and
        remember it for future reference.
