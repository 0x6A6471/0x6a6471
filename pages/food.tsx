          My girlfriend and I love food. We love trying new places, cuisines,
          keeping track of what we loved, what we liked, and what we didn&apos;t
          care for. Since moving to Boston, we have been introduced to a new
          realm of restaurants. It&apos;s quite different than what we were
          accustomed to in Appleton, WI. There&apos;s food everywhere here. So,
          we thought it would be cool to keep track of the food we&apos;ve
          tried, give it a rating, and remember it for future reference.
